Casey reminisces about the appearance of several Mark Wunsch Twitter parody
accounts and is reminded of the "unmasking" of Satoshi Nakamoto by Newsweek.
How does anonymity or pseudonymity coexist with authorship? What connects our
virtual avatars to our physical presence? Mark (who is not a cryptographer)
does his best to explain cryptography and how it's used to verify identity and
establish trust. Casey and Mark evaluate Keybase.io, a public key directory.
Casey asks "Is there such a thing as anonymity online?"
