  Casey and Mark talk about making a podcast.
---

Casey and Mark, back in July, talk about making a podcast named _Abstract Factory_.
It's an episode 6 months in the making! Casey and Mark talk about working on a
project that is outside their _wheelhouse_.  Mark frets about audio quality and
the frustrations of editing the podcast. Casey talks about his latest creative
project. How does the creative sausage get made and when is the right time to
just "ship it"? How precious should we be about our creative projects? What's
the feedback loop between a creative work and its audience? Mark and Casey don't
worry about their "reach". It's difficult to keep a schedule, but it would
be easier if the podcast running time wasn't constrained. Mark and Casey talk
about different kinds of podcasts and where they want Abstract Factory to be.
Mark lists his favorite podcasts that he subscribes to (at least in July&hellip;).
Casey and Mark recall how _Abstract Factory_ came to be and look back at our work.
We come up with one more idea for a project.
