apart of. Mark shares some of his earliest online community experiences and
thinks about the nature of community tools. How do tools influence their
community?  What can we learn from the Teen Wolf fandom? Casey teaches Mark
about *Dark Social*. Casey and Mark discuss the communities that are being
built around Twitch.tv and how communities form around broadcasters and
broadcasting tools. Casey talks about "effortlessly positive communities". 
Casey and Mark discuss the *Twitch Plays Pokémon* experiment.
